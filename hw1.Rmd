I think a **biostatistics** job is very related to *data science*. Biostatistics is the application of statistical methods to a wide range of topics in biology. Today we integrate data science into the statistical aspects. In a biostatistics job we need to create visuals and model data and therefore it falls into the wider umbrella of data science.
